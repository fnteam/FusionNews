			<h1><a name="installation" id="installation"></a>New Installation</h1>
			<p>You should upload all of the files located in the 'upload' directory to a directory on your website. If you are using a FTP client, all *.html, *.php, *.css , and *.js files should be uploaded in <strong>ASCII</strong> mode, and the remaining files in <strong>Binary</strong> mode. Most FTP clients available will do this automatically, but make sure that it is uploading the files correctly.</p>
			<p>The installation script was created to make it easy to use, and with the least amount of user input necessary. To begin the installation process, go to the install.php file through your web browser. If your domain name is http://www.mydomain.com, and you uploaded Fusion News to a directory called 'news', you would type in the address http://www.mydomain.com/news/install.php.</p>
			<p>Once there, follow the instructions. After the installation process is complete, <strong>ensure that you delete the install.php file</strong> to prevent any one from attempting to reinstall Fusion News.</p>
